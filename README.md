# Personal Website

A very simple static personal website written using just HTML/CSS/JS.
The homepage shows tiles of different showcased projects.

To prevent writing tedious `.html` files, I've setup a simple build system. 
The `./content/project/` directory contains a project in the form of:
```
thumbnail.jpg
info.json
main.md
main.html (auto-generated by build.py)
```

Building the project will add info of individual projects to the `./projects.json` which then are used to generate the tiles on the homescreen. Furthermore, the build script also converts the markdown files to html. This makes it easier to "just" write the project pages in interactive article form.

## Build/Run

```
python build.py
python -m http.server 8000
```
